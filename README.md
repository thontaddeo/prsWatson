# Paper, Rock, Scissors Watson Engine

Quick example of Paper, Rock, Scissors script, built using both composition and
inheritance.

#### Clone the git repository to your project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThonTaddeo/prsWatson

### TODOS:

1. Pull strategies out of the player types and into composable "Strategy"
classes.

2. Players should be stored in Game instances as a dictonary where the player
number would be the key and the Player instance would be the value.
